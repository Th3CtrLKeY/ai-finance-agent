### ## üöÄ Overview

This project was built to solve the problem of information overload for retail investors. The agent automates the tedious process of gathering and analyzing market data by:
1.  Fetching real-time stock prices.
2.  Aggregating the latest news from financial markets.
3.  Performing sentiment analysis on news headlines using a specialized NLP model.
4.  Using a powerful LLM (Gemini 1.5 Pro) to synthesize all the information into a professional, human-readable report.

### ## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

The agent uses a modular, multi-tool design. The main orchestrator (`agent.py`) dynamically calls specialized tools to gather information before synthesizing the final report.
